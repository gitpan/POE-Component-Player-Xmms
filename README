NAME
    POE::Component::Player::Xmms - a wrapper for the "Xmms" player

SYNOPSIS
            use POE qw(Component::Player::Xmms);

            POE::Component::Player::Xmms->new({ alias => 'xmms' });
            $kernel->post(xmms => play => 'test.mp3');

            POE::Kernel->run();

DESCRIPTION
    This component is used to manipulate the "Xmms" player from within a POE
    application.

METHODS
  spawn
    Used to initialise the system and create a module instance. The optional
    hash reference may contain any of the following keys:

    alias
    Indicates the name of a session to which events will be posted. Default:
    "main".

    xargs
    Allows for passing extra arguments to the underlying application. (NOT
    used if already running)

EVENTS
  Xmms::Remote events
    The methods available to Xmms::Remote are dupicated as events, heres the
    list: playlist_clear, playlist, play, get_playlist_length, get_volume,
    set_main_volume, get_main_volume, is_repeat, is_shuffle, get_info,
    get_playlist_file, get_playlist_time, set_volume, get_balance,
    get_balancestr, set_balance, get_skin, toggle_aot, main_win_toggle,
    pl_win_toggle, eq_win_toggle, prefs_win_toggle, get_output_time,
    get_output_timestr, stop, is_playing, quit, get_playlist_pos,
    set_playlist_pos, jump_to_time, get_playlist_files, get_version,
    is_running, show_prefs_box, set_skin, all_win_toggle,
    get_playlist_titles, get_playlist_title, eject, playlist_next,
    playlist_prev, pause, toggle_shuffle, toggle_repeat, playlist_delete,
    playlist_add, playlist_add_url, jump_to_timestr, jump_to_time,
    get_playlist_timestr, is_main_win, is_pl_win, is_eq_win, get_eq, set_eq,
    get_eq_preamp, set_eq_preamp, get_eq_band, set_eq_band

    For now, just $kernel->call these to get the return values. I will
    document these and add event replys for everything later.

EVENTS
    Events are fired at the session from which the *spawn()* method as
    called from. Currently there is only one event fired.

  xmms_started
    This event is fired by the player's notification that it's ready.
